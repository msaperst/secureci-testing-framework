# Selenified Testing Framework
The Selenified Test Framework provides mechanisms for simply testing applications at multiple tiers 
while easily integrating into DevOps build environments. Selenified provides traceable reporting for 
both web and API testing, wraps and extends Selenium calls to more appropriately handle testing errors, 
and supports testing over multiple browsers locally, or in the cloud (Selenium Grid or SauceLabs) in 
parallel. It can be a great starting point for building or improving test automation in your organization.
